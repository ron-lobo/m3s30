<h2>Java Version History</h2>
<p>The Java language has undergone several changes since JDK 1.0 as well as numerous additions of classes and packages
	to the standard library. Since J2SE 1.4, the evolution of the Java language has been governed by the Java Community
	Process (JCP), which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and specify additions and changes to the
	Java platform.<br>The language is specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS); changes to the JLS are managed
	under JSR 901.</p>

<p>In addition to the language changes, other changes have been made to the Java Class Library over the years, which has
	grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5. Entire new APIs, such as Swing and
	Java2D, have been introduced, and many of the original JDK 1.0 classes and methods have been deprecated. Some
	programs allow conversion of Java programs from one version of the Java platform to an older one (for example Java
	5.0 backported to 1.4) (see Java backporting tools).</p>
<p>
	Regarding to Oracle Java distribution, the version 11 is a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version.
	("Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support"); Oracle released for the "legacy" Java 8 LTS the last free
	"public update" in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates
	for personal use up to at least December 2020.[1] Java 10 is the previously supported rapid release version. Java 10
	support ended on the same date that support for Java 11 began, in September 2018. Java 7 is no longer publicly
	supported, and Java 9 has stopped receiving updates since Java 9 was a short-term rapid release version that has
	been superseded by Java 10 and now Java 11. For Java 11, long-term support will not be provided by Oracle for the
	public; instead, the broader OpenJDK community, as AdoptOpenJDK or others, is expected to perform the work.[2]
